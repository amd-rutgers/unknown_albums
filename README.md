Unknown Albums

Joy Division, _Unknown Pleasures_

Create album art for a fictional album using Processing. Using the randomization features in Processing, your album art should have at least **2 components that are different every time the album is generated**.

Your album cover should have:

1. An artist name
2. An album title
3. At least 1 graphical element

While Processing is capable of including images, I would recommend avoiding the use of images to preserve print quality.

Good luck!
